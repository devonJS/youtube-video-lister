# jukin-feedamajig
======================
Please follow these instructions very carefully. Reading comprehension and attention to detail counts!

People just can't get enough of our videos, we need to give them a page to check out all our latest and greatest content from JukinVideo.


It just has to be really simple and work, but it would be good to impress the boss. You'll be taking over this project and it may become more sophisticated, so maintainability should be a key attribute of any solution. Don't worry about it working in any environment other than 'development'.

We had a junior developer working on it, and he built something that isn't quite ready and just needs "a little more work".

try: http://localhost:8080/jukin-thingamajig/github/list/repos

Suggested areas to improve:

when the application starts, the default URL should go to the main page
page load time must be less than 4 seconds. A good solution is around 2 seconds, and a great one is sub 2 seconds.
if you have time, making the UI prettier would be nice
Please fork the project, make your changes the "master" branch, and submit a pull request to this project when complete. Email me at jerry@jukinmedia.com if you get stuck or need hints, happy to clarify.

Thanks!
