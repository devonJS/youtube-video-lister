# jukin-feedamajig
======================
Please follow these instructions very carefully. Reading comprehension and attention to detail counts!

People just can't get enough of our videos, we need to give them a page to check out all our latest and greatest content from JukinVideo.
Our designer has created a basic html template to work with. We want a list of all the playlists on our channel, and to display all the videos for that playlist
on the page. It just has to be really simple and work. You'll be taking over this project and it may become more sophisticated, so maintainability is an important attribute of any solution. Performance is also a key factor. 

Main Requirements : 

You'll find all the API information you need in the Youtube api docs : https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/

You'll need to use our channel id : UCsVXjNRWJMyXViNLM2pyMfg for most of the calls.

Target page load time is 2 seconds.

After a video is complete the next video should play.

Upon closing the pop-up the video should stop playing.

Everything should be fast and dynamic as possible.

It's your choice of frameworks/libraries for implementation, feel free to be creative. 

UI/UX additions and improvements are welcome!

For getting a local environment up and running quickly I recommend MAMP or Node.js

Don't worry about it working in any environment other than localhost.


Please fork the project, make your changes the "master" branch, and submit a pull request to this project when complete. Email me at jerry@jukinmedia.com if you get stuck or need hints, happy to clarify.

Thanks!
